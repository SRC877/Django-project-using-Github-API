# Django-project-using-Github-API

This is a simple Django project where we call the Github Api to fetch data and render the view. 

Download the project and run the server.

You can visit the following urls:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/,   
http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/test/,   
http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/profile/ .

When you navigate to the url http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/profile/, it asks you for a github user name. Then it shows the corresponding data against that specific username.

This project uses Python and Django for backend, and for front-end we have used JavaScript,Bower and Twitter Bootstrap.
